# Karen

*WIP*

Karen is a HTML rendering engine implemented in Common Lisp.  
We're planning to make it conform to HTML5.1 and CSS3.

Now HTML-parser isn't implemented, so we are using [cl-html5-parser](https://github.com/copyleft/cl-html5-parser) as an alternative.
CSS-parser is also not implemented, but we couldn't find a suitable one. We'd like to develop those in the future.
